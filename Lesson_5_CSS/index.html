            Augusta Ada Byron was born in December 1815 in London. Her parents were Anne Isabella Byron and George Gordon
            Byron but best known as Lord Byron. Anne Isabella (called Annabella) was a good mathematician and was already
            gifted as a child. Her parents hired a retired professor from Cambridge University and she received an education
            in classical literature, philosophy, science and mathematics. At the time of Ada's birth, Lord Byron was one of
            England's most famous poets and a supporter of romanticism. He was a notorious womanizer, constantly in debt and
            had a reputation as "mad, bad and dangerous to know".
            The marriage between Annabella and Byron may seem strange as they were very different but they were married at
            the beginning of 1815. The marriage did not last long but a month after Ada's birth they separated and Byron
            fled to France and would never see his daughter again.

                Charles Babbage began work on his "The Analytical Engine" in the mid 1830s and he and Ada Lovelace
                became
                good friends and she served as a sounding board and was fascinated by this machine and its
                possibilities.

                In 1840, Babbage was invited to Turin to give a lecture attended by Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian
                engineer. He then wrote the first text on "The Analytical Engine". In 1844, Ada was asked to translate
                this
                text into English, where she also expanded a lot, e.g. with the appendix known as "Note G" containing
                instructions for how a program in "The Analytical Engine" would work. It is "Note G" that is usually
                called
                the first computer program and Ada therefore the first programmer.

                Unlike Babbage, Ada saw the possibility that "The Analytical Engine" could be more than just a machine
                that
                does mathematical calculations. Without it, it would theoretically be possible to create music or art.
                This
                is how she writes in "Note G".

                "Supposing that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical
                composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose eloborate and
                scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent." (Hollings C, Martin U, Rice A, s.82)

                Unfortunately, Babbage's "The Analytical Engine" was never built as he was not given any money to build
                it.

                Perhaps to her mother's disappointment, Ada had a fascination for her father whom she never met (he died
                in
                1824). She appreciated poetry and thought about writing mathematical poetry. Her approach to mathematics
                is
                perhaps best described in this sentence from a letter to her mother.

                “If you can’t give me poetry, can’t you give me poetical science?”

                Perhaps it was precisely Ada's interest in mixing mathematics, logic, fantasy and poetry that made her
                see
                things in a different way.
